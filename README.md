## Overview

This project involved a full redesign and large-scale refactor of an existing website, followed by converting it into a highly responsive, app-like experience with added functionality.

The original system was built on an older .NET framework and a legacy frontend structure. As part of this project, the application was modernised both visually and technically, then deployed for production use.

In parallel, **10ticks.co.uk** was also redesigned, porting over the same design language to maintain visual consistency and a unified brand experience across platforms.

Due to confidentiality, the source code cannot be shared publicly. This repository documents the work through screenshots and design mockups instead.

This included:
- Mobile-first responsive layout

- Improved touch interactions and performance on mobile devices

The result functions as a mobile application while maintaining a unified, modular codebase.
